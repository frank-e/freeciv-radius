[nation_native]

; This is an example nation ruleset for Freeciv 2.5.*

; Nation rulesets are included by default/nationlist.ruleset, and
; this default nation list is included by classic/nations.ruleset,
; civ2civ3/nations.ruleset, etc.

; Your "personal" (example) ruleset with a personal/nations.ruleset
; can include classic/nations.ruleset to get these classic nations
; with the classic settings (traits, initial government, ...)

; You can add  *include personal/native.ruleset (example) after this
; to define a "native" nation as in this (complete) example.

; The flags are normally defined by the tileset.  Amplio and small
; tilesets include misc/flags.spec and misc/shields.spec for normal
; flags and shields.  Amplio2 includes misc/flags_large.spec and
; misc/shields_large.spec.  If the flags for your personal nations
; are not covered by this procedure you can create a dummy tileset
; and add the missing flags in the [sprites] section of any *.spec;
; same idea as in the relevant misc/*.spec files.

; You can also define flag_alt in your personal nation rulesets to
; (ab)use the flag of another nation.  You can disable the nations
; of these borrowed flag(s) as "conflict", see below for an example.
